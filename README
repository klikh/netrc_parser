The parser of .netrc (_netrc on Windows) file content.

Extracted from intellij-community codebase.
It is not needed there anymore, but I don't want to loose it completely.
Will return if needed.

The .netrc file format is:
machine host.com
  login username
  password my_password123

Requires IDEA SDK to run.

The test depends on some test utilities from Git plugin.
